			<p>Landmark Church has resumed the majority of our normal activities. Join us in person at 10am on Sundays for Worship, at 6:30pm on Thursdays for Celebrate Recovery, and throughout the week for life groups. Sunday childcare has also returned. We continue to be strict with our cleaning measures and still offer a socially distanced seating section. Our Sunday live stream is always available if you cannot attend in person.</p>
