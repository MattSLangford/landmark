    <h2>Landmark Church Groups</h2>

	<p>You were designed to live and belong in community! Life Groups and Freedom Groups provide a space to connect with a community of believers and be transformed as disciples of Christ.</p>

<blockquote>“Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.” <strong>Romans‬ ‭12:2‬ ‭NLT</strong>‬‬</blockquote>

<h3>Join a Group</h3>

<p>Life Groups meet weekly each semester with the purpose of growing healthier in an area of our lives with the help of God and others. Whether you need to grow spiritually, work on your physical or mental health, strengthen relationships, or learn financially healthy habits, there are others who are ready to journey with you. Find the group for this season of your life by asking yourself, “where do I need to cultivate healthier habits in my life right now?” If you don't see a group that interests you, start one that does!</p>

<p>Freedom is a 12 week curriculum designed to help you grow spiritually and lead a victorious life in Christ. You will learn foundational truths, examine your own beliefs and experiences, and take steps to lead an abundant life, free of fear and shame. Whether you are a new believer or you have followed Christ for decades, Freedom is for you! Each semester ends with a Freedom Conference that many describe as life-changing.</p>
