    <h2>Connect at Landmark Church</h2>
		<p>Landmark is unlike most churches. We believe that true disciples of Christ should be willing to get their hands dirty by doing things the world truly needs.</p>
    <p>We believe Jesus Christ can cause a personal transformation that is so strong, it will in turn transform the world. We act on that belief by making sure you can find an understanding member of Landmark in your darkest place at your darkest hour. We come from broken homes, destroyed marriages, bad histories, and unloving families. The people of Landmark, along with Jesus, help us overcome the darkness.</p>
    <p>If you’re new to Landmark, we only have one thing to say. <strong>Welcome Home.</strong></p>

<h3 id="visit">Plan a Visit</h3>
<p>If you'd like to visit Landmark Church in person, we want to make that as easy as possible for you. We are located at <strong>1610 West Willow Street in Lafayette, Louisiana</strong>. <em>Some GPS apps will list the city as Scott, LA.</em> We are accessible from I-10 using either the Ambassador Caffery Parkway exit or the University exit.</p>

<p>Our Sunday Worship Service begins promptly at 10am. If you have kids under 12, you're invited to check them into Sunday Class when you arrive. A volunteer will be happy to give you any instructions you may need. We also offer Celebrate Recovery on Thursdays at 6:30PM in our gymnasium. As a guest, do not feel obligated to give in the offering. We want you to be comfortable, we have no dress code. Service typically lasts a little over an hour and includes worship music and preaching.</p>

    <h3 id="#beliefs">Our Beliefs</h3>
    <p>There is One God. As our Father, He is the creator of the universe and everything in it including man. When Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden, everything changed. Because we needed a savior, He became flesh and paid the ultimate price for our redemption by dying in our place. Three days later, He triumphantly rose from the dead having defeated hell and the grave. His death, burial, and resurrection became our hope. This is the gospel.</p>
    <p>Heaven is the eternal reward of those who hear and obey the gospel. Hell is reserved for those who refuse.</p>
    <p>Grace opens the door to salvation. Faith is our response to His grace. Confession is our acknowledgement of His existence and our dependence on Him. Repentance is an intentional decision we must make to turn our back on sin, and, along with Baptism in His Name, is for the remission of sins. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the promise given to all believers. To be eternally saved, we must endure in faith until our heavenly Father takes us from this earthly life.</p>
    <p>We believe our conduct and conversation reveal our allegiance. We must endeavor to live a life that reflects His glory in every way. We will present ourselves appropriately both publicly and privately.</p>
    <p>When our story encounters His story our testimony is born. This “new” story is our greatest means for fulfilling our divine purpose, which is wrapped up neatly when it says:</p>
    <blockquote>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. (NKJV)
    Luke 4:18-19</blockquote>
    <p>Jesus is coming again! First, to resurrect those who died in Christ and to catch away all living disciples. Then, to establish a new kingdom on earth that will last a thousand years.</p>
    <p>We know God still heals and works miracles. We prove this not just from scripture but also by personal experience.</p>

   <h3 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h3>
<p>There are many connection points at Landmark throughout the year. We offer semester based Life Groups where you can meet others in a small group setting. During the fall, we have a 12-week Freedom Group that discusses how you can let go of the things you no longer need in your life. Every week, we have Celebrate Recovery where you can confide in trusted sources and get help overcoming anything. For ages 12-17, we have Youth Intensive every other week during service (and other events). Multiple times per year, we provide a free catered lunch to everyone in attendance on a given Sunday.</p>
<p>We also operate an independent non-profit organization, Safehouse, that provides Sober Living homes in our community (amongst other things). There are frequent volunteer opportunities through this organization.</p>
