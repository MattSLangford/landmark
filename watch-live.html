    <p>We live stream all Sunday services at 10am (9am and 11am beginning on May 31) in HD across many devices. You can watch in any web browser (computer or mobile) or on devices such as an AppleTV, Amazon Fire, Xbox, or Roku (by using the “Livestream” app on each device). You can also watch on Facebook.</p>
    <p>You can watch archived services throughout the week (access archives in the above player by clicking the icon in the top right with a play button in a square). Archives are not available on Facebook.</p>
    </p>We have also introduced CHURCH AT HOME in an effort to provide worship services, devotions, downloads and more while we combat coronavirus (COVID-19). During this time, we’ll be broadcasting on most Wednesday evenings as well.</p>
